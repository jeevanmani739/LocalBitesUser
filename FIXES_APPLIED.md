# Fixes Applied - All Issues Resolved ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ 401 Unauthorized Error During Registration

**Problem:** Users couldn't register - getting 401 error when trying to create profile

**Root Cause:** Profile was being created manually after signup, but RLS policies prevented the insert

**Solution:**
- Created a database trigger (`handle_new_user()`) that automatically creates a profile when a user signs up
- The trigger runs with SECURITY DEFINER, bypassing RLS restrictions
- Simplified the signup function to let the trigger handle profile creation
- Metadata (full_name) is stored in `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data` and copied to profile

**Files Modified:**
- `/lib/auth.ts` - Simplified signup function
- Database trigger created via SQL

### 2. ✅ Route Warnings - "No Routes Found"

**Problem:** Console showing warnings about missing routes

**Root Cause:** Root layout declared routes that didn't have corresponding screen files

**Solution:**
Created all missing screen files:
- `app/checkout.tsx` - Checkout screen
- `app/addresses.tsx` - Address management
- `app/add-address.tsx` - Add new address
- `app/order/[id].tsx` - Order detail screen

All screens created as placeholders ready for implementation.

### 3. ✅ Complete File Structure Verification

Verified all required files are present:

## Database Status

✅ **All Tables Created:**
- profiles (with automatic creation trigger)
- restaurants (8 sample restaurants)
- menu_items (44 menu items with images)
- addresses
- orders
- order_items
- reviews
- payments

✅ **Database Trigger Created:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

This automatically creates a profile for every new user signup.
